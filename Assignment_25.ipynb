    "\n",
    "Ans: Iterators - Iterator is an object used to iterable objects like lists,tuples etc. An object is called iterable if it can be iterated through loop.\n",
    "Generators - A generator is somewhat of a function that returns an iterator object with a succession of values rather than a single item. A yield statement, rather than a return statement, is used in a generator function. "

    "\n",
    "Ans : Contrast - List comprehensions are used when a list of results is required as map only return a map object. List comprehensions is more easy to ready as compared to the result of the map calls.\n",
